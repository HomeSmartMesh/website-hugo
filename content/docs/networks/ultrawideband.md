{{<faq>}}
What is Ultra Wide Band ?
<--->
It's a radio technology that is not based on classical frequency or amplitude modulation rather uses a rich signal pulses that occupies a large spectrum band.
<===>
What does Ultra Wide Band mean for home automation ?
<--->
Very low energy level allows small battery operated tags to achieve functions like precise indoors positioning, which so far could only be achieved with heavier equipment like cameras that need high processing power localisation algorithms.
