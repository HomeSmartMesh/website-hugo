## Devices Overview

Below are examples of used devices in this project 

{{< figure src="/images/zigbee_devices.png" width=600 >}}

As in the above figure, I kept all the light with the hue gateway for a reliable function, and opted for zigbee2mqtt for all other non lighting devices.

For a detailed list of used devices and their documentation see the [devices list](#devices-list) section

## Frameworks
### Philips Hue
{{< image src="/images/hue.png" class="center" width=150 >}}

✅ Philips Hue have an open API that can run in a local network, therefore allowing third party apps integration. This API has been tested in this project, it is of professional grade and reliable.

{{< my_button href="https://developers.meethue.com/develop/get-started-2/" text="meethue developers" >}}

* [Hue Light Control](/docs/raspi/readme/#hue-light-control) from Aquara wall switches and buttons
* The [Smart Home3D webapp](/docs/webapps/home3d/) is using the hue API, and advanced light groups dimming with 3d sliders

### Zigbee2mqtt
✅ The most popular framework that enables DIY fans to use even non-standard devices on standard gateways

❌ as this project is diconnected from the devices vendors integration testing, some instabilities and interoperabilites issues might be expected for some devices

#### Useful commands

```bash
> cd /opt/zigbee2mqtt
> ./update
> sudo systemctl restart zigbee2mqtt
> nano /opt/zigbee2mqtt/data/configuration.yaml
> nano /opt/zigbee2mqtt/data/database.db
> pub 'lzig/bridge/config/permit_join' -m 'true'

### Layers Architecture
In this Figure from the `Zigbee Pro 2015 Page2`, We see the multiple layers, mainly the physical, the MAC, the network and the application. It is therefore not appropriate to compare Zigbee with other networking protocols such as wifi given that the zigbee includes standardisation of the Application layer (APL)

## Firmware
### ZBOSS

ZBOSS 3.0 and 2.1 are independent, portable, high-performance Zigbee® software protocol stacks

{{< my_button href="https://dsr-zboss.com/" text="dsr-zboss.com" >}}

### Nordic integration

The ZBOSS is used in Nordic devices either as lower stack with the application running on the same SoC or used as a Network Coprocessor

### TI Z-Stack
{{< image src="/images/stack_3_0.jpg" class="center" width=200 >}}


This is the Stack used by [Zigbee2mqtt](#zigbee2mqtt)

## Wireshark sniffing

* Observing the network is mandatory for experiemnting with zigbee devices, as it's sometimes not possible to identify the source of the issue (end device or coordinator) without looking at the air messages.
* Note that an RF sniffer for 802.15.4 is enough to sniff zigbee as the zigbee higher layer protocol dissection is supported by wireshark

### Nordik Dongle dev kit
Unfortunately not supported by Zigbee2mqtt, but there's chance in case they move to a ZBOSS common stack. Nevertheless, it's possible to use it as a sniffer give the zigbee being the stame standard in the air physical layer.

❌ Unresolved mystery : it happened few times in 2 years that a device starts spontaneously heating with full power after a sort of connection loss or self reset. Not funny when this happens in summer, especially when someone is not at home. No answer from the support.
