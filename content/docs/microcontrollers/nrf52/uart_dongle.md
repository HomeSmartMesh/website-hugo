A usb dongle from the market that includes a **2104** serial to usb converter. Keyword search on shopping websites : **nRF52832 USB dongle**. Aka "nRF52832-YJ-17017-USB-UART"

# Software
## RF to Serial Gateway
The node connected through serial port will report messages in text format
1. Local Events

Upon startup such message is sent

    nodeid:75;channel:10;reset:1

2. Listening

Upon activation of the uicr config ```is_listening``` the node starts acting as a gatewy that will report messages through serial in text mode

    rssi:-50;id:73;ctrl:0x81;src:73;alive:68;tx_power:0

3. commands requests and responses

It is possible to reconfigure the Node on runtime and manage manage a mesh network by sending messages

    cmd:0x0102
    cmd:0x<command id><arguments>

| Command id | Function | Parameters |
--- | --- | --- |
| 0x01 | Set Node Id | Node Mesh Short Identifier|
| 0x02 | Get Node Id | |
| 0x03 | Set RF Channel | 0:2400 MHz - 100:2500 MHz|
| 0x04 | Get RF Channel | |
| 0x05 | Set Tx Power | 0x04: +4dBm - 0xD8: -40dBm|
| 0x06 | Get Tx Power | |
| 0x07 | Set Bitrate | tbd |
| 0x08 | Get Bitrate |
| 0x09 | Set CRC | 0 : No CRC - 1 : 8bit - 2 : 16 bit|
| 0x0A | Get CRC |  |
| 0x0B | Set UICR | used uicr registers |
| 0x0C | Get UICR |  |


### Command examples
Set channel 10/0x0A

    cmd:0x030A

get channel

    cmd:0x04

Set Tx Power to  -4dBm/0xFC

    cmd:0x05FC

Set UICR e.g. RF Channel @ CUSTOMER[1] to channel 10

    cmd:0x0B010A

Send message, directed (not broadcast) with ttl = 2, ping(75/0x4B) from 73/0x49

    msg:0x7201494B

Send message to execute on the RF target node 75/0x4B the command Set Tx Power to -4 dBm

    msg:0x72EC494B05FC

Send message to execute on the RF target node 75/0x4B the command Set channel to 0x0A

    msg:0x72EC494B030A

Send request to execute on the RF target node 75/0x4B the command Set channel to 0x0A
The only difference to the previous example is that an intermediate ack for the request is not required before getting the response

    msg:0x22EC494B030A

### Switch between serial SERIAL and LOG over UART
run

    make conf

then switch both flags :
* nRF_Log/NRF_LOG_BACKEND_UART_ENABLED
* Application/APP_SERIAL_ENABLED
don't forget to save

### Serial mode
* NRF_SERIAL_MODE_IRQ flag is not used by the driver and has equivalent function as NRF_SERIAL_MODE_DMA

* ser_send() must be used with a variable in memory as DMA cannot read from Code in Flash

## Needle adapter
Making a needle adapter is made easier with 3d printing. The used pogo pin is seen below

The adapter model still in preparation can be found [here](https://a360.co/2IcKZK9). It should look something like this:
